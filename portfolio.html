      <p class = "stuff">In the 2021-2022 school year, I researched the negative impacts of brain injuries to the dorsolateral and ventromedial portions of the prefrontal cortex and wrote a research paper! You can read the paper in the link below!

    <p class = "stuff"><img id = "car" src="assets/rubberband-car.jpg" alt = "Image of a side view of car made of cardstock. The wheels in the back are double the size of the wheels in front and a rubberband is seen in the center that would be wrapped up around the wheels to allow it to move."> <br> <br>  I made a car out of paper clips, straws, and paper that runs on rubber bands for a physics class and it even went 20 feet! </p>

      <p class = "stuff"><img id = "game" src="assets/trivia-world.png" alt = "Image of the title 'Welcome to Trivia World' with an earth below and play and how to buttons below in a pixel art theme."> <br> <br>I created a game in Java from scratch with a friend called Trivia World. It was a game where you have to find a hidden image and then solve a trivia question. You have to get 5 questions right to win. Above is the intro page of my game that I made myself!</p>
    
    <p class = "stuff"><img id = "sky" src="assets/painting.jpg" alt= "Painting of a sky with clouds. The sky is made with navy and purple blended with each other and white clouds on top."> 
      <br><br>After a large gap because of school, I started painting again and this was what I made!</p>
